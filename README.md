## API Architecture

The API is built using different layers: routes, controllers, services and models.

- Routes are responsible for handling the incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate controller.
- Controllers are responsible for validating the request, calling the appropriate service, and sending back the response.
- Services are responsible for handling the business logic. They interact with the database and any external services. Services may also call other services.
- Models are responsible for interacting with the database. They contain the schema and any model utility methods.

#### Error Handling

Errors are handled using a custom error handler middleware. The error handler middleware catches all errors that occur in the application and processes them accordingly. Each controller needs to be wrapped with the `errorCatch()` utility function to ensure that any errors that are thrown within the controller are caught and passed on to the error handler middleware.
